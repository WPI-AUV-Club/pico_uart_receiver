UART:
Heartbeat
Checksum (CRC would be cool)
Seqeuntial Packet Numbers
Watchdog implemented on slave (Reset by valid packets?)	

Slave:
Verify packet has good content before setting motors
If no packet is received after a certain time, all motors stopped
Alert Master to Bad/Missing packets (Indicator light if possible)
Sends ACK to Master with incrementing ACK labelling so watchdog resets are noticed
Has watchdog in case it hangs

Master:
Expect a good ACK signal after each motor request
Always have some minimum freq of motor updates to keep slave happy
Gives warning if it misses ACK signal at expected freq, gives error if it stops
Gives warning if Slave reboots (ACK index goes back to 0/decreases)


18.8ms IDLE

Could be fun to write sim code to turn desired thrust vectors into motor commands - need thruster positions and rotations
